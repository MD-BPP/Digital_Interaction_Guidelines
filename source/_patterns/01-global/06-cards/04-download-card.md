Used to display available downloads. These may take different forms: Exams, PDF's, Factsheets etc. 

The card displays the type of file, the size of the file and if possible should take the first page of the file as a thumbnail image.

Developer Notes:
- The h3 must have a title tag as long titles get truncated. The title tag allows users to hover over to see the full title
