title: Top Nav

The top nav is a global navigation item that sits at the top of the header. It contains "Students" and "Employers" links and a selection of icon based links.

The "Search" link is persistent as is the "Accounts". The Basket icon only appears when you are in an e-commerce area until you add something into your basket. At that point it persists across all pages until your session ends.

**Links**
- **Students**: www.bpp.com
- **Employers**: employers.bpp.com
- **Accounts**: www.bpp.com/accounts
- **Search**: www.bpp.com/site-search

**PLEASE NOTE**
The search icon that appears in this pattern is currently incorrect. We are in the process of updating the Icon Font that is our preferred method of icon delivery. If you are sent designs with a different icon on, then please use what is provided in the design. If in doubt please contact someone at BPP.
