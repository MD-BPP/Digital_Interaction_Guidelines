title: Header
state: inprogress

The header is split into 3 sections. Top bar, brand bar and the nav bar. The top bar and the brand bar should appear in the same way on every page globally across our digital offerings. The nav bar may have different navigation items dependant on the area of BPP you are in.

The top bar will only ever contain a maximum of 5 links. 'Students', 'Employers', 'Basket', 'Accounts' and 'Search'. Other than the 'Basket' icon, each of the others will persist in each area of BPP. The basket icon will initially only appear in e-commerce areas of BPP such as Dates and Prices, Learning media and Course builder however once an item has been placed in the basket (technology allowing) the basket icon will persist for the duration of your session.
