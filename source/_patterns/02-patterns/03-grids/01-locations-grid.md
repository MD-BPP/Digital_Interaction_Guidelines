When there are 4 locations there are 3 columns. One consists of a large square container, another consists of a tall thin column and the third consists of two small squares placed vertically. These containers can be in any order however the headline location should be in the largest square.

**Relevant utility classes:**
- .location-grid: The container that holds the location containers
- .location-container: Any container within a location grid
- .location-column: A column containing 2 small location-containers
- .half: Makes a location container half the width of the .location-grid
- .location-content: Container which holds the name and address of each location
- .location-content-wrapper: a wrapper which allows for centering and top/bottom pseudo elements to appear on hover
